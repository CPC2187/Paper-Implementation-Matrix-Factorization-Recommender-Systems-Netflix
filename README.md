###Instructions 

1) _recommender_final.py_ is the final recommender, and requires _mf.py_ to be imported to run. Use directly on any dataset by changing line 19 in _recommender_final.py_.   

2) _recommender_final_toy_dataset.py_ shows how exactly Matrix Factorization Techniques work by considering a 5x5 toy dataset.   

3) The _*.ipynb_ files include visualizations of RMSE decreasing with iterations when fitting on the training dataset. All _*.ipynb_ files are standalone and do not require importing _mf.py_
